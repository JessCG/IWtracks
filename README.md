# IWtracks
Tools to generate particle tracks in linear or weakly nonlinear internal waves.

## Description
Currently, this repository contains the function `IWtracks.m`, which generates tracks for depth-keeping and passive particles in non-breaking linear and weakly nonlinear internal waves, as described in Garwood et al. (2020). The function requires Smyth et al. (2011)'s `ddz.m`, which is currently [available online](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/salty/matlab-tools-to-solve-the-viscous-taylor-goldstein-equation-for-both-instabilities-and-waves/) and included for reference.
